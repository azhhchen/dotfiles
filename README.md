# 🌱 Dotfiles Configuration

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repo — the digital toolbox powering my daily workflow. Designed primarily for Arch Linux (with a side of Ubuntu).

## 🖥️ Platform

- **OS**: Arch Linux (daily driver), Ubuntu (sidekick)
- **Machine**: ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6, Macbook Pro 16 inch (2019)

## 🧰 What's Inside?

Here's a sneak peek into my curated setup:

- **Git** – `.gitconfig`, `.gitignore` for clean commits and global sanity  
- **Zsh** –  with aliases, plugins, and productivity hacks  
- ~**Starship**~ – (deprecated, switch to original prompt ⚰️)  
- **Ghostty** – My terminal, styled and snappy  
- **Neovim** – Lua-configured `init.lua`, plugin ecosystem tailored for speed  
- **Vim** – Legacy setup, still usable and customized  
- **Tmux** – Tiling terminal multiplexing wizardry 🧙‍♂️  
- **Yazi** – A fast and minimal file manager config  
- **Zed** – Keybindings and tweaks for a lightweight coding flow (testing)
- **VS Code** – Custom keymaps and user settings  
- **Scripts** – Handy tools in `.script/` to automate the boring stuff
